# MS-V Trig

## This circuit is a Eurorack module integrating Korg MS-20 and Eurorack synthesizers.

Eurorack and Korg synthesizers use different control voltages for triggers and gates.
This module bridges the gap by converting Korg S-Triggers into Eurorack CV triggers, 
and Eurorack CV triggers into Korg S-Triggers.

Three CV to S-Trig and two S-trig to CV inputs/ outputs are available.

Schematics and PCB have been designed using KiCad 5.0

The physical layout assumes the 3.5mm jacks to be panel mounted and connected to the 
PCB using wiring, with the sleeve lugs connected between the jacks and finally to GND 
on the PCB.
